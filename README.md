Proposed Model with Customized + Open Source Techniques
1- Juputer file 'Yahya-HybrideEncript-Thesis-Dataset.ipynb' has use dataset of SMS 'SMSforEncryption.xlsx' downloaded from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
2- This file 'Yahya-HybrideEncryptModel.ipynb' have encrypted all SMS.
3- Output files 'ProposedModelEncryptedMessages-2356.xlsx', hybride-Image key and encrypted message file on drive generted by providing code 2356.
4- Output files 'ProposedModelEncryptedMessages-2357.xlsx' and hybride-Image key generted by providing code 2357.
5- Output files 'ProposedModelEncryptedMessages-2358.xlsx' and hybride-Image key generted by providing code 2358.
6- Output files 'ProposedModelEncryptedMessages-2359.xlsx' and hybride-Image key generted by providing code 2359.
7- Jupyter file 'Yahya-HybrideDecrypt-Thesis-Dataset' will use key from image-Key by reciever and will decrypt all messages encrypted on drive.

Direct Open Source Techniques
8-Jupyter file 'AES-Encryp-DataSet.ipynb' will use complete dataset and will encrypt data on drive and generate 
output file 'AESModelEncryptedMessages.xlsx' for analysis with proposed work. File 'AES-Derypt-DataSet.ipynb' will decrypt all messages from drive.
9-Jupyter file 'FernetEncrypt-DataSet.ipynb' will use complete dataset and will encrypt data on drive and generate 
output file 'FernetModelEncryptedMessages.xlsx' for analysis with proposed work. File 'FernetDecrypt-DataSet.ipynb' will decrypt all messages from drive.
10-Jupyter file 'salsa20_Encryption-DataSet.ipynb' will use complete dataset and will encrypt data on drive and generate 
output file 'salsa20ModelEncryptedMessages.xlsx' for analysis with proposed work. File 'salsa20_Decryption-DataSet.ipynb' will decrypt all messages from drive.
11-Jupyter file 'pyaes-AESEncryptor-DataSet.ipynb' will use complete dataset and will encrypt data on drive and generate 
output file 'pyaesModelEncryptedMessages.xlsx' for analysis with proposed work. File 'pyaes-AESDecryptor-DataSet.ipynb' will decrypt all messages from drive.

Analysis
12- Jupyter file 'AES-ProposedModel-Graph.ipynb' will anlayse proposed model with direct AES model.
13- Jupyter file 'Fernet-ProposedModel-Graph.ipynb' will anlayse proposed model with direct Fernet model.
14- Jupyter file 'Salsa20-ProposedModel-Graph.ipynb' will anlayse proposed model with direct Salsa20 model.
15- Jupyter file 'PYAES-ProposedModel-Graph.ipynb' will anlayse proposed model with direct PYAES model.

Complete Model for all user
16- Any user can use Jupyter File 'Yahya-HybrideEncryptModel.ipynb' for decryption of any message using proposed work and can decrypt message through
jupyter file 'Yahya-HybrideDecryptModel' by providing code from image-key (generated through encryption file).
